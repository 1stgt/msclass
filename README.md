**SMS Spam Classification Web App**
**Overview**
Welcome to the SMS Spam Classification Web App project! This end-to-end web application is designed to efficiently classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate using machine learning techniques. The project incorporates a user-friendly interface deployed on Streamlit, making it accessible for easy interaction.

**Data Preprocessing with NLP**
Utilized a Kaggle dataset as the foundation for the project.
Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and clean the data effectively.

**Machine Learning Model**
Implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for accurate spam detection.
Achieved an impressive 97% accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

**Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classification.git

**Install Dependencies**
